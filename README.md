Welcome to BBQS-EMBER repository, which helps visualizes and manages the integration of metadata standards for neuroimaging and behavioral data across the EMBER, DANDI, NWB, and BIDS platforms.

## Repository Overview
This repository hosts a PlantUML diagram and supporting documentation that delineate how the EMBER, DANDI, NWB, and BIDS metadata standards connect to support data organization across multiple domains in neuroimaging and behavioral research.

## Metadata Standards
- **EMBER (Ecosystem for Multi-modal Brain-behavior Experimentation and Research):** EMBER is the BRAIN Initiative data archive for multi-modal neurophysiological and behavioral data. It includes details on the principal investigator, species studied, sensors used, and data modalities, supporting the Brain Behavior Quantification and Synchronization (BBQS) Program
- **DANDI (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration):** A public archive of neurophysiology datasets, including raw and processed data, along with associated software containers. It is designed to work seamlessly with NWB and BIDS formats
- **NWB (Neurodata Without Borders):** A flexible standard for storing neurophysiology data that complements the data management needs of the neuroscientific community
- **BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure):** A framework that standardizes the organization of neuroimaging data and metadata to facilitate sharing, reuse, and analysis

## Current Enhancements 
The repository is actively developed, addressing various enhancements to improve metadata integration and repository documentation:
- Streamlining metadata workflow between community standards and platforms
- Enhancing utility of the data model
- Continuous improvement of data governance and access control
