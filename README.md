Welcome to BBQS-EMBER repository, which helps visualizes and manages the integration of metadata standards for neuroimaging and behavioral data across the EMBER, DANDI, NWB, and BIDS platforms.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains PlantUML diagrams, Mermaid charts, and additional documentation that illustrate how the EMBER, DANDI, NWB, and BIDS metadata standards interconnect to facilitate data organization across various domains in neuroimaging and behavioral research.

## Data
- **EMBER (Ecosystem for Multi-modal Brain-behavior Experimentation and Research):** EMBER is the BRAIN Initiative data archive for multi-modal neurophysiological and behavioral data. It includes details on the principal investigator, species studied, sensors used, and data modalities, supporting the Brain Behavior Quantification and Synchronization (BBQS) Program
- **DANDI (Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration):** A public archive of neurophysiology datasets, including raw and processed data, along with associated software containers. It is designed to work seamlessly with NWB and BIDS formats
- **NWB (Neurodata Without Borders):** A flexible standard for storing neurophysiology data that complements the data management needs of the neuroscientific community
- **BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure):** A framework that standardizes the organization of neuroimaging data and metadata to facilitate sharing, reuse, and analysis

## Current Enhancements 
The repository is actively developed to address various enhancements such as:
- Streamlining metadata workflow between community standards and platforms
- Continuous improvement of data governance and access control
