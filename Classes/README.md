![EMBER Class Structure](EMBER_Project_Class_Structure.png)
The EMBER system supports a multi-tiered data classification strategy, ensuring that different types of data are managed appropriately based on their sensitivity and compliance requirements. This folder describes the system's architecture, data handling protocols, access policies, and compliance measures. This framework is designed to adapt and evolve in response to ongoing research and community feedback

## Class I: Public Access of Open Data
Provides unrestricted access to data that is open to the public, fostering transparency and collaboration in research.

## Class II: Restricted Access of De-identified Data
Allows access under specific data use agreements, ensuring that de-identified data is used responsibly and ethically in research environments.

## Class III: Secure Storage of Sensitive Human Data
Ensures the protection of highly sensitive human data, such as PHI/PII, through secure storage measures, complying with legal and ethical standards.
